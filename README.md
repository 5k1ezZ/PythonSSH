# PythonSSH
Custom ssh client and server made with python 3 using sockets

## Client:
- Run command:  ```python3 sshclient.py <Server IP>```
- Put a "/" infront of any command to only run it on the client machine e.g. ```/Clear``` will only be executed locally otherwise the ```Clear``` will be executed on the server.

## Server:
- Run command: ```python3 sshserver.py```
